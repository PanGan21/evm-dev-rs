# Mini EVM Implementation

A minimal implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) built in Rust for educational purposes. This project was created to better understand the inner workings of the EVM by implementing its core functionality from scratch.

## Overview

This implementation was developed using the comprehensive test suite from [EVM From Scratch](https://github.com/w1nt3r-eth/evm-from-scratch) by [w1nt3r.eth](https://github.com/w1nt3r-eth). The project serves as a learning tool to understand:

- Basic EVM architecture
- Opcode implementation
- Stack-based execution
- EVM's execution context

## Running the Project

To run the implementation:

```bash
cargo run
```

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to w1nt3r.eth for creating the excellent [EVM From Scratch](https://github.com/w1nt3r-eth/evm-from-scratch) test suite, which made this learning journey possible. The test suite provides a structured approach to building an EVM implementation, starting from basic operations and progressively moving to more complex features.

## Educational Purpose

This project is meant for educational purposes only and should not be used in production. It's designed to help developers understand EVM internals by implementing them from the ground up.
